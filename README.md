# Plant Disease Detection

Created for final project of UTD Deep-Dive AI Workshop

Plant diseases not only threaten the health of our crops but also have far-reaching economic consequences. Globally, plant diseases lead to a staggering loss of $220 billion in crop production annually. This substantial economic burden affects farmers, consumers, and the entire food industry raising costs and causing shortages. This is why early detection of plant diseases is vital. Identifying diseased plants at the initial stages is crucial to mitigating their impact on crops and agriculture as a whole. Early detection enables farmers to take appropriate measures promptly. By recognizing the presence of disease early on, they can implement targeted strategies to manage and control its spread effectively.

Through many years of research and experience, scientists have determined that deeper networks generally perform much better than shallower networks.  Many winners of previous image classification contests have leveraged deep convolutional neural networks with tens of layers.  However, these powerful models are often plagued with vanishing and exploding gradients- where the errors generated are pushed to very small or very large numbers due to repeated multiplication causing the model to stop learning or to quickly diverge.  In addition, deep models suffer from a greater problem.  Model performance begins to quickly degrade after too many layers and the models begin to be very hard to train.  ResNets solve this problem with skip connections allowing information to pass through.

In our testing, ResNet has greatly increased the accuracy and efficiency of our model.  With only 2 epochs, our ResNet model approached 99% accuracy on our validation dataset while our plain CNN model only had 85% accuracy after 10+ epochs.  ResNets enable early plant disease diagnosis because our eyes arenâ€™t equipped to detect these minute but deadly symptoms. Additionally, ResNets converge faster compared to other CNN models.
